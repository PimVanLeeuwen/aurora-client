# Aurora Client
This repository contains the narrowcasting application of the Aurora software suite.
It is the subscriber that is used by _Screen_ entities.
After authenticating using HTTP, the client will connect to the core using SocketIO
to listen for incoming commands. It will then execute these commands accordingly.
However, if extra information is needed (for example to render a certain poster),
the client can make HTTP calls to the core to request this data.

## Prerequisites
- NodeJS 20.
- A locally running copy of [aurora-core](https://github.com/gewis/narrowcasting-core).
  The backoffice repository should be cloned next to the core repository, so in the folder `../aurora-core`.
  This is necessary to generate the required API client files (installation step 2).

## Installation
1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run gen-client` to generate the Typescript files required to communicate with the core.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. The application should now be running at http://localhost:8080.
You can authenticate a screen on the client by going to th URL https://localhost:8081/?key=KEY_HERE.

## Deployment
Deployment is done using Docker-compose in the core repository.
This should work out of the box if you meet the prerequisites.
